## Description

The goal of this project is to create a command line application in Ruby.

## Project Requirements

- Provide a CLI for a user to browsing vehicle listings
- The CLI application provides access to data from a web page.
- The data provided must go at least one level deep. A "level" is where a user can make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice.

## Set Up

I decided to use [Bundler](https://bundler.io/v2.0/guides/creating_gem.html) to get my project off the ground.
Bundler provides everything that is needed to get started quickly so you do not need to waste time setting your project directories etc.

## Data Source

For this project, I am retrieving vehicle listings from [CarGurus.com](https://www.cargurus.com/) to build vehicle objects.

## Conclusion

You can find the completed project on [GitHub](https://github.com/anahimana/carly).
